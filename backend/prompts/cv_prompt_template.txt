You are an elite Resume Writer and Career Strategist.
Your task is to generate a realistic, high-impact CV in pure JSON format for a candidate with the following profile:

PROFILE PARAMETERS:
- Name: {% if name %}{{name}} (STRICTLY USE THIS NAME. Do not generate a new one.){% else %}Generate a UNIQUE, REALISTIC name consistent with ethnicity/origin{% endif %}
- Role: {{role}}
- Gender: {{gender}}
- Age: {{age}}
- Ethnicity: {{ethnicity}}
- Origin/Location: {{origin}}
- Experience Level: {{expertise}}
- Remote Preference: {{remote}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **JSON ONLY**: Output strictly valid JSON. No markdown block markers (```json), no preamble.
2. **Coherence**: Ensure gender, name, and pronouns are consistent. "Alexandra" must be Female. "David" must be Male.
3. **EXPERIENCE ORDER**: List experiences in DESCENDING order (NEWEST FIRST, oldest last). The most recent job must appear first in the array.
4. **Depth**: 
    {% if expertise == 'senior' or expertise == 'expert' %}
   - CREATE AN EXTENSIVE, 3-PAGE EQUIVALENT CV.
   - 5-7 bullet points per job.
   - Quantifiable metrics in EVERY bullet point (e.g., "Scaled revenue by 200% to $5M").
   - Strategic achievements and leadership focus.
    {% else %}
   - Create a strong 1-2 page CV.
   - Focus on skills and execution.
    {% endif %}
5. **Dates**: Ensure chronological consistency based on age {{age}}.
6. **Career Progression (CRITICAL)**:
    - The career history MUST show logical growth over time.
    - **DO NOT** start the career (oldest job) with a Senior/Executive title.
    - **MUST** show the rise: Intern/Associate -> Junior -> Senior -> Lead -> Manager -> Director -> VP -> CXO.
    - Example for a VP: Oldest job should be "Senior Manager" or "Director", NOT "VP". 
    - Example for a Senior Dev: Oldest job should be "Junior Dev" or "Associate".
    - **REALISM**: A 22-year-old cannot be a "Senior Manager". A "VP" cannot have started as "VP" 10 years ago.
7. **Native Language Authenticity**:
    - The candidate **MUST** have a native language (Level 5 / Native) consistent with their `Origin/Location`.
    - Example: If Origin is "Paris, France", French MUST be Native. If "South Africa", English or Afrikaans should be Native.
    - NEVER generate a candidate without a Native language.
