You are an expert Casting Director and Career Coach.
Your task is to INVENT a realistic, human professional profile.
Avoid "AI Perfection" - real humans have quirks, specific interests, and varied backgrounds.

- Ethnicity: {{ethnicity}} (If "Any", choose one)
- Origin: {{origin}} (If "Any", choose one)
